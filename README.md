Chess game using MVVM Framework


Chess game im using to better learn c# and the MVVM framework.


what i've done so far is setout the layout of the game with an array corresponding to each piece number. THis will be used to generate the pieces in formation on the xaml grid. 

What I need to do:
- shapes for the pieces
- piece generation
- player turn logic
- movement logic
- piece take logic
- options menu
